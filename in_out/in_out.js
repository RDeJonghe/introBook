// INPUT / OUTPUT Exercises

// 1. Write a dynamic greeter program named greeter.js. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, {name}! where {name} is the name you entered:
  /*
  let name = prompt('What is your name?');
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  */

// 2. Modify the greeter.js program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.
  /*
  let first = prompt('What is your first name?');
  let last = prompt('What is your last name?')
  console.log(`Hello, ${first} ${last}!`);
  */

// 3. Modify the age.js program you wrote in the exercises for the Variables chapter.
  /*
  let age = Number(prompt('How old are you?'));
  const IN_10 = age + 10;
  const IN_20 = age + 20;
  const IN_30 = age + 30;
  const IN_40 = age + 40;
  console.log(`You are ${age} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 10 years you will be ${IN_10} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 20 years you will be ${IN_20} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 30 years you will be ${IN_30} years old.`);
  console.log(`In 40 years you will be ${IN_40} years old.`);
