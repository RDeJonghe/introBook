// Exercise 2 from Objects Chapter Intro to Programming with JavaScript

// 2. Which of the following values are valid keys for an object?

// 1 valid, will turn this into a string
// '1' valid
// undefined valid will turn into a string
// 'hello world' valid
// true valid will turn into a string
// 'true' valid will turn into a string

// All valid because will turn into strings. But note that 1 is equal to '1' here since 1 is converted to '1'
